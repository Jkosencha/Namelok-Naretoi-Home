            <p>
                Susan Nenkai entered the world on October 31st, 2017, at 9:00 PM, at Entasekera Health Centre. Her
                mother, a seventh-grade dropout, faced uncertainty upon Susan's birth. Nurses at the facility, unsure
                how to handle the child's multiple disabilities, urged family members to visit. Fearing curses or
                witchcraft, the family was distressed by Susan's condition. <br>

                Witnessing Susan's challenges for the first time, I, too, felt overwhelmed. Despite the uncertainty, I
                offered support and reassurance to the family, emphasizing reliance on faith and exploring available
                options. Through conversations with Susan's mother, who felt stigmatized and frightened, I encouraged
                her to embrace her role in caring for her daughter, eventually convincing her to breastfeed. <br>

                Namelok Naretoi proposed funding Susan's surgery, with financial backing from Wellspring International.
                This intervention transformed Susan's life and that of her mother. Initially met with skepticism,
                Susan's ability to walk and integrate into society astonished her community. Through ongoing medical
                rehabilitation, Susan has blossomed into a joyful, beautiful girl, albeit with continued clinical
                oversight. <br>

                Looking ahead, Namelok seeks support for Susan's education once she reaches school age. We hope
                Wellspring will consider aiding her in the future. Sadly, Susan's father, unable to accept her
                disability, abandoned her to her grandmother's care, despite her mother being married. <br>
                
                Without the intervention of Wellspring through Namelok Naretoi, Susan would have likely faced a dire
                fate. Her young mother, still in school, initially rejected the child, and the family lacked the means
                to provide necessary care. Gratitude is extended to Wellspring, with blessings upon their team, for
                bringing a smile to Susan's face. The narrative of rejection surrounding Susan has been completely
                overturned. <br>
